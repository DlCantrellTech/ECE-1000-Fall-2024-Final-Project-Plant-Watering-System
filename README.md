# ECE-1000-Fall-2024-Final-Project-Plant-Watering-System
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during development of our automated plant watering system.
##Project Summary
This project is aimed at providing a failsafe to caring for plants, whether for decoration or consumption. Many plants have a volatile nature when water is conserned, leading to severe consequences if the caretaker were unable provide water on a regular schedule. The system we developed is capable of monitoring the moisture content of the soil for a given plant and automatically dispensing water at the desired parameters.
##Project Capabilities
The main goal of the project has be autonomy, so the main functionality comes as:
- measurement of soil moisture level on an adjustable interval
- dispense water via electric motor/pump based on moisure measurement
Additional functionality was added and planned for, such as:
- overide button to activate pump manually
- LED display for current moisture level (not implemented)
